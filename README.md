## Option A (Recommended) — Build the APK with GitHub Actions

GitHub can compile the application for you, free of charge, in the cloud.

1. Create a free account on GitHub.
2. Create a new **public** repository.
3. Upload the entire project (including the `.github` directory) and commit the files.
4. The build starts automatically. Open the **Actions** tab and wait for the **Build APK** workflow to complete.
   *(If it doesn't start automatically: **Actions → Build APK → Run workflow**.)*
5. Once finished, open the workflow, scroll down to **Artifacts**, and download **`app-debug-apk`**. The ZIP archive contains `app-debug.apk`.

### Installing the APK on a Samsung Galaxy S10e

1. Copy `app-debug.apk` to the phone (USB cable or direct download).
2. Open it with the file manager. Android will ask permission to install apps from unknown sources—allow it.
3. Install **LocalBeats**, grant access to your audio files, then open **Settings → Scan Library** to detect your music.

> The **debug APK** is perfectly suitable for everyday use. The optional
> **release APK** is unsigned and cannot be installed directly; it can safely
> be ignored for personal use.

## Option B — Build the Project Yourself with Android Studio

1. Install Android Studio.
2. Select **File → Open** and open the project folder.
3. Wait for Gradle to synchronize and download dependencies.
4. Select **Build → Build App Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**.
5. The generated APK will be located in:

```
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

Android Studio is also the recommended environment for fixing build errors.

## Technology Stack

* Kotlin 2.0
* Jetpack Compose
* Media3 / ExoPlayer 1.4 (playback + background playback)
* Room (playlists and history)
* DataStore (settings)
* Coil (image loading)
* Navigation Compose

**Minimum SDK:** 26 (Android 8.0)
**Target SDK:** 34

Project structure:

* `app/src/main/java/com/example/localmusic/` — source code
* `app/src/main/res/` — resources
* `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — permissions and services

## Troubleshooting Build Errors

The source code is complete but has not been compiled or tested on a physical device.

If the build fails:

* **GitHub Actions:** open the failed workflow, expand the **Build Debug APK**
  step, and read the error message (file and line number).
* **Android Studio:** build errors appear in the **Build** window. Clicking an
  error takes you directly to the corresponding line of code, making it the
  easiest environment for debugging.
